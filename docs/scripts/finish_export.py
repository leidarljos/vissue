"""Finish the org to RST export: restore the toctree, refuse a corrupting shape.

Two failures here are quiet rather than loud, which is why they are checked
instead of trusted:

- Pandoc drops a trailing ``rst`` export block often enough that a build comes
  out with every guide orphaned and no way to reach it from the index.
- A line that begins with ``[12]`` is a footnote *definition* in RST. When the
  citation markers in this project's prose land at column zero, docutils eats
  the surrounding sentence into a footnote nobody references. The build still
  succeeds; the page loses text.
